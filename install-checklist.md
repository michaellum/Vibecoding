Track your progress through each stage. You can complete these over multiple sessions.

## Prerequisites ✅
- [x] VS Code installed
- [x] Node.js and npm installed via Homebrew
- [x] Claude Code CLI installed and authenticated
- [x] Claude Code VS Code extension installed (optional)

## Setup Stages

### Refactor: Move to Base Directory ✅
- [x] Moved all project files to `/Users/michael.lum/Vibecoding/`
- [x] Maintained Git history and project structure
- [x] Verified development server works from new location
- [x] Committed refactoring changes

**Current project location:** `/Users/michael.lum/Vibecoding/`

---

### Stage 1: Basic Vite Setup ✅
- [x] Created Vite React TypeScript project
- [x] Installed dependencies
- [x] Started development server successfully
- [x] Verified localhost:5173 shows default Vite React page

**What you learned:**
- Vite is faster than Create React App
- TypeScript adds type safety to JavaScript
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) automatically refreshes the browser

**Current Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

### Stage 2: Git Setup ✅ (Re-verified)
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create initial commit with Vite boilerplate
- [x] Understand git concepts (repository, commits, staging)
- [x] Successfully moved repository to base directory
- [x] Maintained complete Git history during refactor

**What you learned:**
- Why version control is essential
- Basic git workflow (add, commit)
- What .gitignore does
- Git identity configuration
- How to safely refactor project structure while preserving Git history

**Current Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

### Stage 3: Project Structure & Dependencies ✅
- [x] Install ShadCN UI setup
- [x] Install Tailwind CSS
- [x] Install React Router
- [x] Install Class Variance Authority
- [x] Create directory structure (components, pages, prototypes, etc.)
- [x] Set up configuration files
- [x] Configure path aliases

**What you learned:**
- ShadCN UI provides pre-built, accessible components with Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind CSS uses utility classes for rapid styling
- Project structure: components/, pages/, prototypes/, lib/ directories
- Path aliases (@/) simplify imports and improve code organization
- CSS variables enable theme switching and design tokens

**Current Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

### Stage 4: Core Templates & Routing ✅
- [x] Create PageTemplate.tsx (with navigation)
- [x] Create BlankTemplate.tsx (clean canvas)
- [x] Set up React Router with dynamic routing
- [x] Create routes configuration system
- [x] Add basic theme provider
- [x] Create initial test pages

**What you learned:**
- Template pattern provides consistent layouts and reusable structure
- React Router enables client-side routing with createBrowserRouter
- React Context manages global state like theme preferences
- Theme provider supports system, light, and dark modes with localStorage persistence
- Navigation components use location hooks for active states

**Current Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

### Stage 5: Design System Foundation ✅
- [x] Set up design tokens in CSS custom properties
- [x] Implement typography system
- [x] Create color system with theme support
- [x] Add first ShadCN components
- [x] Create theme-aware components

**What you learned:**
- Design tokens provide consistent spacing, colors, and sizing across components
- CSS custom properties enable dynamic theming and easy maintenance
- Typography systems create visual hierarchy and improve readability
- ShadCN UI components (Button, Card, Badge) integrate seamlessly with Tailwind
- Theme toggle demonstrates React Context and localStorage integration
- Component composition patterns for building complex UIs

**Current Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

### Stage 6: GitHub Integration & Deployment ⏸️
- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Connect local repo to GitHub
- [ ] Push initial code
- [ ] Set up GitHub Pages deployment
- [ ] Configure build process for production
- [ ] Create deploy script

**What you'll learn:**
- GitHub workflow basics
- Deployment concepts
- Build vs development environments

**Current Status:** ⏸️ NOT STARTED

---

### Stage 7: Polish & Documentation ⏸️
- [ ] Create project README
- [ ] Add development commands documentation
- [ ] Set up linting and formatting
- [ ] Create sample components
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Performance optimizations

**What you'll learn:**
- Documentation best practices
- Code quality tools
- Performance considerations

**Current Status:** ⏸️ NOT STARTED

---

## Key Commands Reference

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Building
npm run build

# Adding ShadCN components (later stages)
npx shadcn@latest add <component>

# Git basics (Stage 2)
